    <h4><font color="#0071f7">Q. What the heck is IpfsCloud?</font></h4>
    <h6 style="padding: 10px;">IpfsCloud <font color="blue">aims to be an open, decentralized, anonymous and peer-to-peer marketplace for data storage on <a href="https://ipfs.io"><b>Ipfs</b></a></font>.
        <b>Right now, it is not decentralized in real sense.</b> Of Course, we are working on that.
        Currently, it has 5 sections:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>My documents</b>: <b>Store data that you want to be public</b>. Anyone with the link to this data can see, share and download it. 
                You can your Photos, Videos(pretty much every thing) which you share on the Internet. You can <b>share data via email</b> within the website.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                <b>My Private Docs</b>: <b>Store data which you want to keep private</b>. When you upload a document, you will be asked to <b>add a password to protect(encrypt) your file</b>.
                 When you want to view your files, you will have to enter the password. So, <font color="red">keep your password safe and don't loose it.<br>
                 As it is still in development phase, so please don't store anything that is important. Atleast, keep a copy with you.</font><br>
                 Later in development we will introduce methods which will protect your file using your identity(each account will have a key-pair which is generated when an IPFS node is created. Your data will be encrypted using those keys)
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Sync with mobile</b>: This will allow you to <b>scan a QR Code with your mobile device and use the same account on your mobile device</b>. The mobile app is still in development.
                    <font color="blue">If you want to be one of the first users to test it out before it hits the playstore/appstore then sign up <a href="https://lnkd.in/fseGedZ"><b>here</b></a></font>. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>My devices</b>: This <b>shows the history about which devices have you used to access your account</b>. This can help you to identify if some other person is/was using your account.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>Free Website Hosting</b>: Here you can <b>host websites for free</b> in 2 simple steps:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <b>Choose your website name</b> : Choose what URL you want for your website. Like if you choose "vasa.com" then your website will be at: https://yoursite.host/vasa.com.  
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Add ZIP file of your website</b>:  Take your website code(folder that contains index.html file),ZIP it and upload it. Your website will be ready in a minute or less. 
                            </li>
                        </ul> 
                    </p>
                </li>
        </ul>
        You can track our progress and contribute to the project on <a href="https://github.com/vasa-develop/ipfscloud">GitHub</a>. It is a project under <a href="https://clusterlabs.io">ClusterLabs</a>, supported by <a href="https://towardsblockchain.com">TowardsBlockchain</a>, a MIT CIC incubated Start up.</h6>
            
    <h4><font color="#0071f7">Q. How it works?</font></h4>
    <h6 style="padding: 10px;">When you upload anything on the IpfsCloud, it is stored on a number of servers which are owned and controlled by community and us. These servers run a software that helps them to communicate with each other,
    similarily as your computer communicates with other computers when you use a torrent.<br>
    Later in the development, every user will have his/her own computer which will run the same software that runs on the servers. So, this will allow you to <b>rent out your unused disk space to other users</b>. This doesn't mean that the other people(who store your files)
    will be able to see your files on their computers(as it will be encrypted and distributed in such a way that the data on single users system cannot be used to retrieve the complete file; and if a few computers are loose your data, you can still get you complete data).
    </h6>

    <h4><font color="#0071f7">Q. Tell me more about IPFS.</font></h4>
    <h6 style="padding: 10px;">You can find more about IPFS <a href="https://ipfs.io">here</a>. If you are more into videos then try <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUVmypx9HGI">this</a>.</h6>

    <h4><font color="#0071f7">Q. What's up with the Google login?</font></h4>
    <h6 style="padding: 10px;">For simplicity for early users, we provide Google login. So, we can access your email(chill out; we will not spam you), name and profile pic. <b>We are planning to remove it soon with better Login methods which reflect our goals.</b> </h6>

    <h4><font color="#0071f7">Q. What's Anonymous login?</font></h4>
    <h6 style="padding: 10px;">If you are <b>using somebody else's device, or just want to checkout IpfsCloud, then this is for you</b>. But <b>REMEMBER</b> that <font color="red">if you logout or delete cookies for this website, then you will loose all the data for the Anonymous account.</font></h6>

    <h4><font color="#0071f7">Q. What can I store here?</font></h4>
    <h6 style="padding: 10px;"><b>Pretty much everything; Photos, videos, documents</b>. <font color="red">As it is still in development phase, so please don't store anything that is important. Atleast, keep a copy with you.</font></h6>

    <h4><font color="#0071f7">Q. Where is my data stored?</font></h4>
    <h6 style="padding: 10px;">Your data is stored on a number of <b>servers hosted by community and by us</b>, which run IPFS software.</h6>

    <h4><font color="#0071f7">Q. How much data can I store?</font></h4>
    <h6 style="padding: 10px;">Right now the platform will not block you after you have uploaded certain amout of data. But the storage is limited to a few hunderd GBs.</h6>

    <h4><font color="#0071f7">Q. For how long my data will be stored?</font></h4>
    <h6 style="padding: 10px;"><b>We try keep the data forever on the servers</b>, until you try to delete it. But as the platform is in development phase, only upload files that are not important.</h6>

    <h4><font color="#0071f7">Q. How can I delete my data?</font></h4>
    <h6 style="padding: 10px;">You can do that by deleting it using the delete button. <b>BUT the data will not be deleted instantaneously. It can take from few minutes, hours or even days, depending upon how many servers have the data</b>.</h6>
